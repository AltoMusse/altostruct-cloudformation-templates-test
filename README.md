# AWS CloudFormation Templates Directory
This directory contains a collection of AWS CloudFormation templates that can be utilized within your project. These templates are designed to simplify the provisioning and management of various AWS services, making it easier to set up, configure, and deploy infrastructure components as code.

# AWS CloudFormation Sample Templates
Use sample AWS CloudFormation templates to learn how to declare specific AWS resources or solve a particular use case. We recommend that you use sample templates as a starting point for creating your own templates, not for launching production-level environments. Before launching a template, always review the resources that it will create and the permissions it requires.

## Available CloudFormation Templates
1. **Aurora Database**: Use the Aurora template to provision Amazon Aurora database clusters, a high-performance relational database service.

2. **RDS Database**: The RDS template enables the creation of Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) instances, offering managed database solutions.

3. **DynamoDB**: Deploy DynamoDB tables with the DynamoDB template, a NoSQL database service for fast and scalable storage.

4. **Memcached**: Provision Memcached clusters for in-memory caching using the Memcached template.

5. **Lambda Functions**: The Lambda template allows you to define AWS Lambda functions, which enable serverless compute for various tasks.

6. **SQS Queues**: Use the SQS template to set up Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queues for messaging between application components.

7. **IAM Roles and Policies**: With the IAM template, you can define Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies for secure access control.

8. **Fargate**: The Fargate template simplifies the creation of AWS Fargate tasks and services for containerized applications.

9. **EKS Cluster**: Deploy an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster with the EKS template, simplifying container orchestration.

10. **Load Balancer**: The Load Balancer template allows you to provision an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) or an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances, enhancing the availability and scalability of your applications.


## How to Use
To use these CloudFormation templates in your project:

1. Navigate to the specific template directory.
2. Review the template's README or documentation for usage instructions and any required parameters.
3. Use the AWS CloudFormation service to deploy the stack based on your project's needs.

By utilizing these templates, you can quickly and consistently provision AWS resources, saving time and ensuring infrastructure as code best practices.
